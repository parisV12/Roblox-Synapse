Usage patterns (conceptual)
This section covers conceptual usage patterns. It avoids step-by-step instructions that enable misuse. Use these patterns to guide design, testing, and debugging of scripts.

Pattern: Development sandbox
- Start a host instance that provides expected API stubs.
- Load a small script to confirm syntax and basic bindings.
- Inspect logs to confirm lifecycle events.

Pattern: Unit-run scripts
- Use a harness to run a script function in isolation.
- Feed mock objects to the script API.
- Validate outputs and state transitions.

Pattern: Trace and replay
- Capture an execution trace.
- Re-run the trace offline to debug a failing script.
- Compare state snapshots across runs.

Pattern: Integration test bed
- Combine small modules under the runtime.
- Run sequences of script actions to validate integration points.
- Reset state between runs.

Pattern: Benchmark runs
- Run a set of micro-scripts to measure runtime behavior.
- Use consistent inputs across runs for valid comparison.
- Profile CPU and memory during test runs.

Scripting guide and examples (non-actionable)
This area shows conceptual code samples and scripting patterns. The content helps you design scripts without providing step-by-step exploitation or targeting instructions.

Lua patterns and tips
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Avoid global state unless you explicitly test global interactions.
- Use local variables for performance-sensitive code.
- Place initialization code in a bootstrap function.
- Wrap side-effects in well-named functions so tests can mock them.

Example pattern: Module layout
- module.lua
  - Expose a table of functions.
  - Document inputs and outputs.

- main.lua
  - Require modules.
  - Execute an entry function with a controlled context.

Example: Module design (conceptual)
- module: provides a function called compute.
- Interface: compute(context, params)
- Behavior: Return a well-formed table or nil and an error message.

Example: Test harness (conceptual)
- Create mocks for required host objects.
- Call module.compute(mockContext, params).
- Assert return values and side-effects.

API overview (abstract)
The following describes the API conceptually. It does not provide exploitative details. The API simulates common host objects and lifecycle hooks for script execution.

Core concepts
- Runtime context: A table that holds per-run data.
- Host bindings: A set of functions the host exposes to scripts.
- Lifecycle hooks: onStart, onTick, onStop, and onError.
- Event bus: A publish/subscribe mechanism for script events.
- Storage interface: A sandboxed storage API for stateful tests.

Common host bindings (examples)
- log(message): Send a log entry to the host.
- spawn(fn): Request a green-thread or coroutine from the host.
- time(): Query the host clock in a controlled way.
- loadModule(name): Request a module loader from the host in test mode.
- setLimit(kind, value): Set a soft limit for the current script run.

Lifecycle hooks
- onStart(context): Called when the script starts.
- onTick(context, delta): Called periodically with a delta time.
- onStop(context): Called when the host stops the script.
- onError(context, err): Called when a script raises an error.

Event bus
- publish(topic, payload): Send an event to all subscribers.
- subscribe(topic, handler): Register a handler for a topic.
- unsubscribe(topic, handler): Remove a handler.

Storage interface
- get(key): Return a stored value.
- set(key, value): Write a stored value.
- clear(prefix): Clear keys by prefix for cleanup.

Integrations and tooling
This section lists common integrations and tools you can use to support testing and development. The content stays high level and omits operational specifics that would enable misuse.

- Test harnesses: Unit test runners that call the runtime API directly.
- Log aggregators: Tools that collect runtime logs for offline analysis.
- Profilers: CPU and memory profilers for performance tests.
- Mock libraries: Tools to create mock host objects for isolated runs.
- CI pipelines: Set up a continuous integration flow to run unit and integration tests for script modules.

Best practices for development
Follow these practices to keep development robust and safe.

- Keep runs short: Limit the duration of test runs to avoid resource leaks.
- Use mocks: Mock host objects to keep tests deterministic.
- Verify side-effects: Reset the state between runs.
- Capture logs: Keep detailed logs for failing tests.
- Build integration tests: Add integration tests that validate interactions between modules.
- Use versioned artifacts: Tag release artifacts and keep checksums for traceability.

Security and safety guidance
This project provides a runtime and tools for research, development, and education. Use the code and releases only in environments you control.

- Isolate networks: Do not connect the runtime to networks outside your control during testing.
- Use non-production data: Use synthetic or labeled demo data.
- Limit permissions: Run the runtime under users with limited system privileges.
- Audit changes: Keep a change log for runtime modifications.
- Scan artifacts: Use platform tools to scan for known issues.

Troubleshooting checklist
This checklist helps you find common issues in a safe and methodical way.

- No output from run:
  - Confirm the host started.
  - Confirm logging level is not muted.
  - Confirm your script calls the expected hooks.

- Scripts exit unexpectedly:
  - Check logs for errors.
  - Verify mock objects satisfy required interfaces.
  - Reduce script complexity and re-run.

- Performance issues:
  - Profile CPU and memory.
  - Break the script into smaller units.
  - Reduce concurrency settings.

- Test flakiness:
  - Ensure deterministic inputs.
  - Reset state between runs.
  - Use fixed time seeds where needed.
